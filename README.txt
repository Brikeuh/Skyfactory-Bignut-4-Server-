Welcome to the Big Nut SkyFactory!

This is a Minecraft SkyFactory 4 Modpack server that collaborators and friends play on.
We're not open to anyone joining without invite.
The server has been uploaded because we dearly care about our progress running through.
There is also another repository for a vanilla playthrough for an old map that we
spent a lot of time on. We plan to go back and forth between the two.
